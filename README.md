  <h1>Dual Axial Solar Tracker</h1>
<p>Solar power is the fastest growing means of renewable energy. The project is designed and implemented using simple dual axis solar tracker system. In order to maximize energy generation from sun, it is necessary to introduce solar tracking systems into solar power systems. A dual-axis tracker can increase energy by tracking sun rays from switching solar panel in various directions. This solar panel can rotate in all directions.</p>
